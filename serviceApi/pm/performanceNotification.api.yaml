    Performance monitoring allows the Buyer/Client to provision entities that
    define performance objectives (Performance Profile, Performance Job),
    collect monitoring data (Performance Report), as well as receive
    notifications about these objects. This allows managing issues and situations that
    are not part of normal operations of the Service provided by the Seller.

    List of supported use cases:
    - Send Event Notification

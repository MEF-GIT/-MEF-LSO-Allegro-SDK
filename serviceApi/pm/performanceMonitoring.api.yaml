    **This file forms part of MEF W143**

    **This API implements part of Business Requirements & Use Cases described
    in MEF W133.1.**

    **This specification represents MEF work in progress and is subject to
    change.**

    MEF Performance Monitoring API allows to manage Performance Profiles, 
    Performance Jobs and collect Performance Reports, as well as receive 
    notifications related to these entities. This allows managing the 
    performance objectives that are typically associated with an SLS. 

    Three types of performance-related entities are supported by the API:
    - **Performance Monitoring Profile** - templates used to simplify the PM 
    Job provisioning. Common attributes for PM Jobs are defined in the PM 
    Profile. One PM Profile can be used by multiple PM Jobs but PM Jobs can 
    be created without relationship to PM Profile.

    - **Performance Monitoring Job** - provisions the performance monitoring
    objectives specific to each subject of monitoring which could be an 
    ordered pair (i.e., two UNIs) or an entity (i.e., port).

    - **Performance Monitoring Report** - The execution of PM Job results in
    Performance Monitoring collections that provide Buyer/Client with 
    performance objective results. In some cases performance collection
    can be produced on Buyer/Client request which can be useful for collecting
    passive statistics or historical data.

    List of use cases supported by the API:
    - Create Performance Monitoring Profile
    - Retrieve list of Performance Monitoring Profiles
    - Retrieve Performance Monitoring Profile by Profile Identifier
    - Modify Performance Monitoring Profile
    - Delete Performance Monitoring Profile

    - Create Performance Monitoring Job
    - Retrieve list of Performance Monitoring Jobs
    - Retrieve Performance Monitoring Job by Job Identifier
    - Modify Performance Monitoring Job
    - Retrieve Modify Performance Monitoring Job List
    - Retrieve Modify Performance Monitoring Job by Identifier
    - Cancel Performance Monitoring Job
    - Retrieve Cancel Performance Monitoring Job List
    - Retrieve Cancel Performance Monitoring Job by Identifier
    - Suspend Performance Monitoring Job
    - Resume Performance Monitoring Job
    - Subscribe to Performance Monitoring Job Notifications
    - Unsubscribe from Performance Monitoring Job Notifications

    - Create Performance Monitoring Report
    - Retrieve list of Performance Monitoring Reports
    - Retrieve Performance Report by Report Identifier
    - Subscribe to Performance Monitoring Report Notifications

        The Buyer/Client requests a list of PM Jobs based on a set
        of filter criteria. The Seller/Server returns a summarized list of PM 
        Jobs. For each PM Job returned, the Seller/Server also provides a 
        Performance Job Identifier that uniquely identifiers this PM Job within
        the Seller/Server. The order of the elements returned to the 
        Buyer/Client is defined by the Seller/Server (e.g. natural order) and
        does not change between the pages.

    **This file forms part of MEF W148**

    **This API implements part of Business Requirements & Use Cases described
    in MEF W133.1.**

    **This specification represents MEF work in progress and is subject to
    change.**

    MEF Fault Management API allows to manage Fault Management Jobs, collect 
    Fault Management Reports, and receive notifications related to these
    entities. This provides the ability for the Buyer/Client to request that 
    the Seller/Server performs FM Job on a Service, and to retrieve the results
    of the Job. Examples of the Fault Management Job are Link Trace 
    and Loopback. 

    Two types of entities are supported by the API:
    - **Fault Management Job** - specifies the Fault Management Job 
    configuration. FM Job is typically run as part of a troubleshooting or 
    diagnostic process of a Service. 

    - **Fault Management Report** - The execution of Fault Management Job 
    creates FM Reports that provide Buyer/Client with the results of the Job.

    List of use cases supported by the API:
    - Create Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve list of Fault Management Jobs
    - Retrieve Fault Management Job by Job Identifier
    - Modify Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve list of Modify Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve Modify Fault Management Job by Identifier
    - Cancel Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve list of Cancel Fault Management Job
    - Retrieve Cancel Fault Management Job by Identifier
    - Suspend Fault Management Job
    - Resume Fault Management Job
    - Subscribe to Fault Management Job Notifications
    - Unsubscribe from Fault Management Job Notifications
    - Retrieve list of Fault Management Reports
    - Retrieve Fault Management Report by Report Identifier
    - Subscribe to Fault Management Report Notifications
    - Unsubscribe from Fault Management Report Notifications

        The Buyer/Client requests a list of FM Jobs based on a set
        of filter criteria. The Seller/Server returns a summarized list of FM 
        Jobs. For each FM Job returned, the Seller/Server also provides a 
        Fault Management Job Identifier that uniquely identifiers this FM Job 
        within the Seller/Server. The order of the elements returned to the 
        Buyer/Client is defined by the Seller/Server (e.g. natural order) and
        does not change between the pages.

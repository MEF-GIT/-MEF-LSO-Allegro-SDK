  ServiceUptime:
    description: The Service Uptime Performance Metric is the proportion of time, during a given time period Tk, that the service is working from the perspective of the Subscriber (for a Subscriber IP Service) or the  perspective of the SP/SO (for an Operator IP Service), excluding any pre-agreed exceptions, for  example maintenance intervals. Reference MEF 61.1[1] Section 10.9 Service Uptime Performance Metric.

  SlsRpPair:
    description: Service Level Specification Reference Point Pair. In a multipoint or rooted multipoint IPVC, performance objectives are ideally specified as applying between pairs of IPVC EPs - in other words, they apply to the performance that IP Data Packets experience as they flow from one EI to another. The SlsRpPair is a representation of this association. Reference MEF 61.1 Section 10.9.1

## Introduction

This repository contains the MEF LSO Carrier Ethernet Service YAML payload schemas.

It also provides Service Schemas for:

- Subscriber UNI
- Subscriber EVC End Point
- Subscriber EVC
- Operator UNI
- Operator OVC End Point
- Operator OVC
- ENNI
- ENNI Service
- Virtual UNI
- Carrier Ethernet Service Level Specification (SLS)

## Release Irene:

**Readiness status**: Call for Comment #4.

**Summary**:
 
 - MEF W101 document no longer uses the term Legato and moves to term Service. 
 the intention is that these schemas are applicable to mulitple Interface Reference
 Points (Legato, Allegro and Interlude) as well as for internal software systems
 (i.e., SOF).

 - MEF W101 document adds complete set of use cases with JSON and PlantUML JSON diagrams.
 
 - The superclasses (resources) CarrierEthernetExternalInterface, CarrierEthernetServiceEndPoint,
 and CarrierEthernetService are removed.  This is done with the intention to simplify and
 flatten the model.
 
 - The following changes are shown for each Carrier Ethernet supporting YAML file.

 - All resource that have an identifier have added pattern: "[\x20-\x7F]+" and minimum length of 1.

 - All required attributes are removed.

 **carrierEthernetCommon.yaml:**
  - CarrierEthernetExternallInterface, a superclass (resource) removed.
  - CarrierEthernetServiceEndPoint, a superclass (resource) removed.
  - CarrierEthernetService, a superclass (resource) removed.
  - CarrierEthernetUni, an abstract class (resource) removed.
  - AdminState and OperationalState removed. State is handled by the envelope part of API (MEF 99).
  - BwpFlow are seperated to IngressBwpFlow and EgressBwpFlow because all attributes are not shared.
  - BandwidthProfilePerClassOfServiceName are separated to IngressBandwidthProfilePerClassOfServiceName
  and EgressBandwidthProfileClassOfService name because not all attributes are shared.
  - CarrierEthernetPhysicalLink replaces PhysicalLayer.
  
 
 **carrierEthernetEnni.yaml:**
  - CarrierEthernetExternalInterface is not referenced. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetEnni.yaml.

 **carrierEthernetEnniService.yaml:**
  - CarrierEtherExternalInterface is not referenced. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetEnniService.yaml.

 **carrierEthernetEvc.yaml:**
  - CarrierEthernetService is not referenced. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetEvc.yaml.

 **carrierEthernetEvcEndPoint.yaml:**
  - CarrierEthernetServiceEndPoint is not referenced. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetEvcEndPoint.yaml.

 **carrierEthernetOperatorUni.yaml:**
  - CarrierEthernetUni is not referenced. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetOperatorUni.yaml.

 **carrierEthernetOvcEndPoint.yaml:**
  - CarrierEthernetServiceEndPoint is not referenced. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetOvcEndPoint.yaml.

 **carrierEthernetServiceLevelSpecification.yaml:**

 **carrierEthernetSubscriberUni.yaml**
  - CarrierEthernetUni is not referenced. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetSubscriberUni.yaml.

 **carrierEthernetVirtualUni.yaml**
  - AdminState and OperationalState removed. Therefore attributes are
  are moved into carrierEthernetVirtualUni.yaml.


## Maturity Level

The schema files contained in this repository are evolving and subject to change. They are
based on documents that are either ratified standards or draft standards that
have not yet completed the review cycles and approvals necessary to achieve the
status as a MEF standard. MEF is making these publicly available at this time to
invite wider industry review.


- Subscriber Ethernet Service Attributes:
  - MEF 10.4 - **Published Standard**
- External Network Network Interfaces (ENNI) and Operator Service Attributes
  - MEF 26.2 - **Published Standard**
- Layer 2 Control Protocols in Ethernet Services
  - MEF 45.1 **Published Standard**
- Developer Guide/API:
  - MEF W101 - **work in progress - CfC#4**

      description: The Service Level Specification Service Attribute (SLS) is, as part of the Service Level Agreement, the technical details of the service level, in terms of Performance Objectives, agreed between the Service Provider and the Subscriber for Subscriber Ethernet Services and between the SP/SO and Operator for Operator Ethernet Services. . A given SLS might contain 0, 1, or more Performance Objectives for each Performance Metric. The SLS is described in section 8.8 (EVC Service Level Specification Service Attribute) of MEF 10.4 for EVCs and section 12.13 (OVC Service Level Specification Service Attribute) for OVCs. MEF 10.4 defines 10 Performance Metrics (all of which are included here). MEF 26.2 defines only 9 Performance Metrics. MEF 26.2 does not include the One Way Composite PM. The other 9 are the same.

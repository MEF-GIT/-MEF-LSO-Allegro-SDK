      EVC/OVC End Point has a single Class of Service.  The Class of Service can be determined from inspection 
      of the content of the ingress EI Frame. It is associated with the SepCosIdPac, or the PcpCosIdPac or the 
      DscpCosIdPac (when the Class of Service Identifier mapping type is Ser-vice End Point or PCP values or 
      DSCP values respectively). In the case of PCP, when an OVC End Point is at an ENNI but not in a VUNI, 
      the PcpCosIdPac refers to the value of the S-Tag PCP field.  When an OVC End Point is at a UNI or in a 
      VUNI, or for any EVC End Point, the Pcp-CosIdPac refers to the value of the C-Tag PCP field.  EI Frames 
      of L2CP protocols may be identi-fied by a Class of Service Identifier, mapping to specified CoS Name.
